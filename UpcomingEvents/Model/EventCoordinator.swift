         Here's where you're looking for my sub-O(n^2) algorithm and I do my best to explain my thought process. Full disclosure- this is one of my weaker areas as a programmer since I don't have a CS degree so I'm interested in your thoughts on this.

         My first attempt at this was to just sort the events and then check the event before and after to see if either one conflicted. The issue with this is that you could have a meeting an hour ago that went only ten minutes, but an all day event that started before the earlier meeting might still conflict. So I'd need to check if the earlier event overlaps OR whether it itself has a conflict, because then I would need to recursively go backwards to see any potential conflicts.

         (Side note, i did think of this, and then after getting everything mostly working, I saw that you guys very purposefully tried to sneak in this scenario on the last day. Well done.)

         This made me think that it would be better to pack things into days first and then apply the algorithm above (especially with the hint in the pdf that there are no events that start and end on different days.
